# BookStore-Management
This project involves creating a web application for book management. ASP.NET is used for the backend API, while HTML, CSS, and JavaScript handle the frontend. The backend includes routes for basic operations like adding, updating, and deleting books, with data stored in-memory(SQL Server) or in JSON format.
